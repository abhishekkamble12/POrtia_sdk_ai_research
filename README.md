üöÄ Quick Start
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher

API keys for:

Google Generative AI (Gemini)

Tavily Search API

Portia API

Installation
Clone or download the application files

Install required dependencies:

bash
pip install streamlit python-dotenv google-generativeai portia
Create a .env file in the same directory with your API keys:

text
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_google_api_key_here
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_actual_tavily_api_key_here
PORTIA_API_KEY=your_actual_portia_api_key_here
PORTIA_MODEL=gemini-1.5-pro
Getting API Keys
Google API Key
Visit https://aistudio.google.com/

Create an account or sign in

Generate an API key for the Generative Language API

Enable the API in Google Cloud Console if needed

Tavily API Key

Running the Application
Start the application:

bash
streamlit run app_gemini_portia_docs.py
Open your browser to the provided local URL (typically http://localhost:8501)

Check the sidebar to verify your API keys are properly configured

Enter your research topic in the text input field

Click "Start Research" to begin the analysis

View the generated research report with sources

üèóÔ∏è How It Works
API Validation: The application validates your Google API key on startup

Agent Initialization: When you submit a research topic, it initializes a Portia agent

Web Search: The agent uses the Tavily search tool to gather current information

Content Generation: Gemini processes the information and generates a structured report

Result Display: The results are displayed in a formatted markdown output
